# Space Bugs

**Space Bugs** is a fast-paced arcade shooter built with Python and Pygame. This game was developed as a real-world experiment using **Bulifier**â€”an AI-powered mobile app that turns bullet points into working code. The project showcases how developers can shift from traditional coding to reasoning through bullet points to create fully functional applications.

## ðŸŽ® Game Features
- Smooth Vector2-based ship movement
- Waves of challenging alien enemies
- Retro-inspired shoot-'em-up gameplay

## ðŸš€ Built with Bulifier
Bulifier lets you outline your ideas as bullet points and syncs them into raw files, giving you the creative freedom to focus on design and logic rather than syntax. This project highlights how:
- **Bulifier** structured and generated core game components.
- **Python & Pygame** powered the game engine and graphics.
- Manual debugging and tweaks refined the game.

> **Bulifier isn't for debugging**â€”it's for thinking differently. You reason in bullet points, not in code!

## ðŸ“± Develop Anywhere
Bulifier is a **mobile-first** development environment, giving you the freedom to build apps anytime, anywhere. Skip the clunky setups and focus on the fun parts of coding!
