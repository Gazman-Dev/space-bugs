- Purpose: Acts as the entry point to initialize and start the Space Bugs game with proper setup, including sound management and loop execution.
- Imports:
  - import pygame
  - from game.game_logic import Game
  - from sound.sound_manager import SoundManager
- Methods:
  - main() -> None:
    - Initialize the pygame library to prepare for game operations.
    - Create an instance of the `SoundManager` class to handle game sounds.
    - Call the `load_sounds()` method of the `SoundManager` instance to preload all necessary sound effects for the game.
    - Create an instance of the `Game` class for managing game state and logic.
    - Invoke the `setup()` method of the `Game` instance to prepare initial game settings.
    - Enter a loop to continuously execute the `game_loop()` method from the `Game` instance. Integrate sound playback where necessary, maintaining game flow until termination conditions are met.
